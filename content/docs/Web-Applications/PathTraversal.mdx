title: Path Traversal
description:  Path traversal attacks, also known as the dot-dot-slash attack, take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots ../.
---

If the attacker finds the entry point, which in this case `get.php?file=`, then the attacker may send something as follows, 
```html
http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```
Suppose there isn't input validation, and instead of accessing the PDF files at /var/www/app/CVs location, the web application retrieves files from other directories, which in this case /etc/passwd. 

Similarly, if the web application runs on a Windows server, the attacker needs to provide Windows paths. For example, if the attacker wants to read the `boot.ini` file located in `c:\boot.ini`, then the attacker can try the following depending on the target OS version:
```html
http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../boot.ini or
http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../windows/win.ini
```
Here are the common OS files you could use when testing:

| Location|	Description|
|---|---|
| /etc/issue | 	contains a message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.
| /etc/profile | 	controls system-wide default variables, such as Export variables, File creation mask (umask), Terminal types, Mail messages to indicate when new mail has arrived
| /proc/version	 | specifies the version of the Linux kernel
| /etc/passwd | 	has all registered user that has access to a system
| /etc/shadow | 	contains information about the system's users' passwords
| /root/.bash_history | 	contains the history commands for root user
| /var/log/dmessage | 	contains global system messages, including the messages that are logged during system startup
| /var/mail/root | 	all emails for root user
| /root/.ssh/id_rsa | 	Private SSH keys for a root or any known valid user on the server
| /var/log/apache2/access.log | 	the accessed requests for Apache  webserver
| C:\boot.ini | 	contains the boot options for computers with BIOS firmware
