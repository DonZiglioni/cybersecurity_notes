## Shadow Hashes
Consider the following line from a modern Linux systemâ€™s shadow password file

```bash
$ sudo cat/etc/shadow | grep user01
> user01:$y$j9T$76UzfgEM5PnymhQ7TlJey1$/OOSg64dhfF.TigVPdzqiFang6uZA4QA1pzzegKdVm4:19965:0:99999:7:::
```
The fields are separated by colons: the username, hash algorithm, salt, and hash value and the second field has the format $prefix$options$salt$hash.

In the example above, we have four parts separated by `$`:
- `y` indicates the hash algorithm used, yescrypt
- `j9T` is a parameter passed to the algorithm
- `76UzfgEM5PnymhQ7TlJey1` is the salt used
- `/OOSg64dhfF.TigVPdzqiFang6uZA4QA1pzzegKdVm4` is the hash value

## Popular Hashes

| Prefix	| Algorithm| 
|---|---|
| $1$ |	md5crypt, used in Cisco stuff and older Linux/Unix systems| 
| $2$, $2a$, $2b$, $2x$, $2y$ | Bcrypt (Popular for web applications)| 
| $6$	| sha512crypt (Default for most Linux/Unix systems)| 
| $y$ |yescrypt is a scalable hashing scheme and is the default and recommended choice in new systems| 
| $gy$| gost-yescrypt uses the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function and the yescrypt hashing method | 
| $7$	| scrypt is a password-based key derivation function| 
| $md5 |SunMD5 is a hash based on the MD5 algorithm originally developed for Solaris |
