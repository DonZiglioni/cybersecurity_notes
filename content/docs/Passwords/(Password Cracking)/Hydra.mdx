description:  Hydra is a powerful tool used for performing brute-force attacks on various protocols and services to test the security of authentication mechanisms
---

## Example
`$ hydra -t 4 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV TARGET_IP ftp`


| SECTION         |   FUNCTION | 
| --- | ---|
| -t 4            | Number of parallel connections per target| 
| -l [USERNAME]   |  Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise| 
| -P [path to dictionary]  | Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords| 
| -vV             |  Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt| 
| [TARGET_IP]     |  The IP address of the target machine| 
| ftp / protocol  |   Sets the protocol (Over 50 different protocols)| 

## Password Spraying
You can use Hydra to bruteforce usernames as well as passwords

`$ hydra -L usernames-list.txt -p Passw0rd123 ssh://10.1.1.10`

## Bruteforce RDP
You can attack a Windows Remote Desktop with a password list!

`$ hydra -t 1 -V -f -l <username> -P <wordlist> rdp://<ip>`




## Bruteforce HTTP login pages

Form syntax: `<url>:<form parameters>:<condition string>[:<optional>[:<optional>]`

#### GET Example
`$ hydra -l admin -P 500-worst-passwords.txt 10.10.x.x http-get-form "/login-get/index.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=logout.php" -f`

| SECTION         |   FUNCTION | 
| --- | ---|
| -l admin            | Specify a single username, use `-L` for a username wordlist| 
| -P  |   Specify the full path of wordlist, use `-p` for a single password| 
| 10.10.x.x [path to dictionary]  | The IP address or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the target| 
| http-get-form            | The type of HTTP request, which can be either `http-get-form` or `http-post-form`| 
| PARAMETERS  |  Specify the URL, path, and conditions.  login-get/index.php is the path of the login page on the target webserver.  username=^USER^&password=^PASS^ are the parameters to brute-force. 


#### POST Example
`$ hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.12.119 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
- The username is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
- The password is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^

`F=incorrect` is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
