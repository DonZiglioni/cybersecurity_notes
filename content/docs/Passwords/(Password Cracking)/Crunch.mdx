title: Crunch
description:  Crunch is a wordlist generator tool that can be used to create custom wordlists based on specified criteria. It generates wordlists through combinations and permutations of a set of characters, which can include numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.
---

## Quickstart

`sudo apt install crunch`

### Usage

The following example creates a wordlist containing all possible combinations of 2 characters, including 0-4 and a-d. We can use the -o argument and specify a file to save the output to.

`$ crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch.txt` 
```
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 
243 bytes 
0 MB 
0 GB 
0 TB 
0 PB 
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: xx 
crunch: 100% completed generating output
```

You can specify a character set using the `-t` option to combine words of our choice
- @ - lower case alpha characters
- , - upper case alpha characters
- % - numeric characters
- ^ - special characters including space

If part of the password is known to us, and we know it starts with "pass" and follows two numbers, we can use the `%` symbol from above to match the numbers.

Here we generate a wordlist that contains pass followed by 2 numbers:

`$ crunch 6 6 -t pass%%`
