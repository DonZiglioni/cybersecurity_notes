## SUID / SGID 
Find all the SUID/SGID executables

```bash
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
find / -user root -perm /4000
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

## Escaping Vim

User has sudo privilege to run Vim
